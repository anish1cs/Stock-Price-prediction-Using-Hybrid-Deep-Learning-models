# Stock-Price-prediction-Using-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-models
**Hybrid Models for Stock Price Prediction**<br>
Welcome to this repository dedicated to advanced hybrid models for forecasting stock prices by combining statistical methods and deep learning techniques.
<br>
Goal: Model both linear trends (ARIMA) and nonlinear patterns (CNN-LSTM) to achieve more accurate and robust forecasts for financial time series.<br>
# Features
✅ARIMA: Captures linear structure, trend, and seasonality<br>
✅CNN: Learns local temporal features in residuals<br>
✅ LSTM: Models long-term temporal dependencies<br>
✅ Hybrid: Combines predictions for best performance<br>
✅ Evaluation: Includes MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and Directional Accuracy metrics<br>
✅ References: Inspired by state-of-the-art research papers<br>
