**Hybrid Models for Stock Price Prediction**
Welcome to this repository dedicated to advanced hybrid models for forecasting stock prices by combining statistical methods and deep learning techniques.
<br>
Goal: Model both linear trends (ARIMA) and nonlinear patterns (CNN-LSTM) to achieve more accurate and robust forecasts for financial time series.
<h>Features<h> <br>
✅ARIMA: Captures linear structure, trend, and seasonality
✅CNN: Learns local temporal features in residuals
✅ LSTM: Models long-term temporal dependencies
✅ Hybrid: Combines predictions for best performance
✅ Evaluation: Includes MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and Directional Accuracy metrics
✅ References: Inspired by state-of-the-art research papers
